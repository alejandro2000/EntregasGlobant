Globant resources and activities

Steps to run the project:

1st step -> Clone the branch according to the project you want to run,
in this case we download or clone the repository with the branch 'feature/005'.

2nd step -> We open the terminal in the path where the project files are located.

3th step -> Run the command 'mvn clean verify' to run all the contained tests.

Note : If you want to run a specific test we just have to modify the pom.xml file.
